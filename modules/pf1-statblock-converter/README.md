# How to Use
1  Copy &amp; Paste Statblocks into the input, you can edit the statblock after copying.
2  Errors, warnings and information will be shown below to help you identify potential errors in the statblock.
3  If you use multiple custom compendia, loading times may get very long.

# Disclaimer
SBC is never finished it seems :D. See change log for latest updates and issues for known bugs.
If you find any errors or have a statblock that can't be converted at all, feel free to open an issue here or let me know on the FoundryVTT Discord.

# Please note
*  The conversion from statblock text to actor is not perfect.
*  To reproduce the statblock as written, some adjustments (e.g. through buffs or changes to attacks) are added automatically (a setting can disable this).
*  Statblocks often include typographical errors (e.g. extra linebreaks) or ligatures (e.g. ﬁ instead of fi). You may need to fix these manually.
*  For important NPCs (e.g. named one's, bosses or the BBEG), check them manually after the conversion!
*  Skills are almost never given in full in statblocks, SBC only fills in the ones given.

# Known Bugs
*  Not all Statblocks are equally formatted. As long as its reasonably well-formed, it should work. If not, check the preview area or console.
*  See Issues. If you find anythings thats not noted there, please let me know.
