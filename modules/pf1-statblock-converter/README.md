## Roll Bonuses PF1 Integration

As of v5.4.0, SBC works with Roll Bonuses PF1 by david aka claudekennilol to set up various bonuses pre-configured:

- Weapon Focus (normal, greater, and mythic)
- Weapon Specialization (norml and greater)
- Armor Focus (normal and improved)
- Elemental Focus (normal, greater, and mythic)
- Spell Focus (normal, greater, and mythic)
- Spell Specialization
- Martial Focus
- Snake Sidewind
- Furious Focus
- Improved Critical
- Versatile Performance
- Weapon Training

In v5.5.0, SBC expanded this to include:

- Favored Enemy\*
- Vital Strike (normal, improved, greater, mythic)
- Devastating Strike (normal and improved)
- Ammo properties (enhancement, bane, flaming, corrosive, shocking, and cold, and their burst variants)\*

\*: The Favored Enemy and Bane require PF1E v11.4.0 and Roll Bonuses PF1 2.20.0!

# Disclaimer

SBC is never finished it seems :D. See change log for latest updates and issues for known bugs.
If you find any errors or have a statblock that can't be converted at all, feel free to open an issue here or let me know on the FoundryVTT Discord.

## Please note

- The conversion from statblock text to actor is not perfect.
- To reproduce the statblock as written, some adjustments (e.g. through buffs or changes to attacks) are added automatically (a setting can disable this).
- Statblocks often include typographical errors (e.g. extra linebreaks) or ligatures (e.g. Ô¨Å instead of fi). You may need to fix these manually.
- For important NPCs (e.g. named one's, bosses or the BBEG), check them manually after the conversion!
- Skills are almost never given in full in statblocks, SBC only fills in the ones given.

## Known Bugs

- Not all Statblocks are equally formatted. As long as its reasonably well-formed, it should work. If not, check the preview area or console.
- See Issues. If you find anythings thats not noted there, please let me know.

## To Do

- Fix bugs
