## 12-21-2024 - v5.0.0

This update is a bit different to say the least. This version is a complete refactor of SBC's structure and processes from one end to the other. As such, almost nothing of the prior versions exist now. This has resulted in SBC being able to do a much more thorough job of parsing the statblocks, finding class features, creating attacks, building spellbooks, and especially processing inventories. This is the shortest summary I can realistically give, as SBC is really just _that much better_ at its job now.

On that note, while I started this refactor solo, I could not have done nearly as good or as timely a job without KitCat's help. They have helped refine SBC's code, clarify processes, remove dead code, pretty much recreated the inventory handling from scratch, and made vast improvements along the way.

For people wanting more thorough details:

- Fixed: SBC didn't account for materials in item names (such as "cold iron longsword")
- Fixed: Skill Ranks would sometimes not get parsed correctly or at all
- Fixed: Vulnerabilities and Weaknesses would cause SBC to fail
- Fixed: SBC failed to detect auras as class features (caused lots of placeholders)
- Fixed: SBC would unreliably process anything with commas (like Lay on Hands with daily uses and amount)
- Fixed: SBC failed to import items from custom compendia
- Fixed: SBC is a lot better about monster special abilities
- Changed: SBC has a new setting (default is OFF) to import the class association features. Default is off for a "statblock-only reading; may cause duplicate features if on.
- Changed: SBC now makes use of the system's HP settings when importing statblocks
- Changed: SBC uses the actor's classes and race when searching for features and other items to restrain potential options
- Changed: SBC builds its own spellbooks, allowing for full processing of any spellbook in the statblock (like multiple Spell-like Ability books)
- Changed: Cantrips are no longer at-will unless explicitly-stated, and cantrips with a daily use limit are properly restrained
- Changed: Miscellaneous notes (CMB, Spellbooks, Saving throws, etc.) are gathered into a misc feature instead of the sourceless fields in the actor sheet
- Changed: SBC now factors in changes from items, feats, features, etc. when processing ability scores, skills, and validation
- Changed: SBC calculates relative offsets for context notes (so "+12 Acrobatics (+14 when jumping)" is interpreted as "+12 Acrobatics" with "+2 when jumping" as a note)
- Added: Processing and importing Mythic Classes, as well as the creation of monsters' mythic ranks and mythic power
- Added: Processing and importing archetypes
- Added: Support for spells and spell items (wands and the like) with metamagics in the name
- Added: Support for materials in inventory and attack proccessing
- Added: SBC will adjust item statistics (weight, price, hp, hardness) based on materials and magic abilities
- Added: SBC adjusts spellbooks to account for prestige classes that progress them
- Added: SBC now imports mythic feats
- Added: Racial HD classes with no levels are turned into races to preserve subtype data
- Added: SBC now supports an API command (`openSBCDialog`), an async command that can be given the text of a statblock to use in the SBC dialog
- Added: SBC processes text inside parentheses to make alterations to attack bonuses, DCs, damage, saves, and uses/charges
- Added: SBC processes formulas in uses, damage, and saves to compare existing formulas to the statblocks to preserve scaling formulas and account for offsets (like +2 uses from "Extra Lay on Hands")
- Added: Actors will have their resources freshly-recharged when importing.
- Added: Racial HD/Creature Type immunities are processed onto the actor (such as Undead being Mind-Affecting effects)

## 09-05-2024 - v4.6.5

- Fixed: Removed unnecessary noise and notifications with custom compendium settings being set by modules.

## 06-30-2024 - v4.6.4

- Fixed: SBC didn't know that the Technology was moved into the system from PF-Content.

- Fixed: Failed to properly update custom languages
- Fixed: Arrows were forgotten about, as well as entries that begain with "And" or a number and weren't money were not being handled properly
- Fixed: Assumed that every class with casting had an offset, which caused conversion validation to fail for most casters.

## 06-26-2024 - v4.6.3

- Fixed: Processing cases where an ability is -- would throw pointless errors.
- Fixed: Conversion Validation would fail for cases like CMB and CMD where the value in the statblock was -- or NaN.

## 06-18-2024 - v4.6.2

- Fixed: Processing flags like CHA to HP or an ability score of -- would break.

## 06-18-2024 - v4.6.1

- Fixed: The hook for loading custom compendiums didn't actually do anything with the data.
- Fixed: Skill changes would break Conversion Validation.

## 06-17-2024 - v4.6.0

- Changed: Updated display of the Preview and Notes formatting when displaying null or blank ability scores, CMB, and CMD values.
- Changed: SBC should now be more accurate when searching for content appropriate to its section (like feats or class features); this comes at the increased likelihood of redundant names, such as "Mesmerist Tricks 6/day (mesmeric mirror)" instead of just "Mesmeric Mirror".
- Changed: SBC now looks for Mythic feats (if the feat name has "M" at the end, SBC changes it to " (mythic)").
- Changed: SBC now replaces the statblock input with the cleaned version for better processing and error logging
- Changed: SBC now processes Ability Scores and Skills _after_ gear and feats have been processed to account for mechanical changes.
- Added: SBC now calls a hook `sbc.loadCustomCompendiums` which can be passed an array of compendiums (of the format "<module-id>.<compendium-id>") to register as part of SBC's Custom Compendiums setting.
- Added: SBC now attempts to update items' actions with damage formulas and saving throws (like auras).
- Added: SBC now adds the aura line from statblocks to the actor's aura field in their traits/attributes tab.
- Added: SBC now tries to find spell items in custom compendiums (potions, scrolls, wands).

- Fixed: Masterwork gear wasn't being marked as such without an enhancement bonus
- Fixed: Masterwork status wasn't accounted for in attack comparison for attack parsing

- Added: two new settings (both default to OFF); one for creating attacks when they match the inventory item and another for whether to process the weapon focus, weapon specialization, and weapon training or leave them to be done later with the Roll Bonuses module
- Fixed: CMB and CMD context notes weren't kept when processing
- Fixed: aura processing would duplicate the aura if there were commas in the entry
- Fixed: edge cases with name detection inside parentheses
- Fixed: tremorsense wasn't processed correctly
- Fixed: spell-based items (like wands) would only process charges, and instead catch CL if given first
- Fixed: special ability processing would ignore the last special ability

- Fixed Copy & Paste Error in Morale parsing (#373)
- Reworked the sequence in which categories get parsed in (#376)

- Hotfix for #362
- Fix for missing abilities in statblock preview (#370)
