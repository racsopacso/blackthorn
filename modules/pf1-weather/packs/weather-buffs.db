Moving into a square during a heavy snowstorm requires 1 extra 5-foot square of movement (this stacks with difficult terrain). Every hour of heavy snow leaves 1d4 inches of snow on the ground. As long as at least 2 inches of snow remain on the ground, the requirement of an extra square of movement to enter a square of snow persists. If at least 1 foot of snow remains on the ground, 2 extra squares of movement are required to enter a snow-filled square instead. A heavy snowstorm has a 10% chance of generating thundersnow and has a 40% chance of becoming a blizzard if the wind speed is severe or stronger.</span></p>","chat":"","unidentified":""},"tags":[],"changes":[{"_id":"npo56f8a","formula":"-6","operator":"add","subTarget":"skill.per","modifier":"penalty","priority":0,"value":0},{"_id":"o4p4avy4","formula":"-6","operator":"add","subTarget":"rattack","modifier":"penalty","priority":0,"value":0}],"changeFlags":{"loseDexToAC":false,"noEncumbrance":false,"mediumArmorFullSpeed":false,"heavyArmorFullSpeed":false},"contextNotes":[],"links":{"children":[]},"tag":"","useCustomTag":false,"flags":{"boolean":[],"dictionary":[]},"scriptCalls":[],"buffType":"temp","active":true,"level":null,"duration":{"value":"","units":"","start":0},"hideFromToken":false,"identifiedName":"Snow, Heavy"},"effects":[],"folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"BtAhBRW9P5xaS8hf":3},"flags":{"core":{"sourceId":"Compendium.world.precipitation-weather-buffs.EUq5fYn39ZATXQjq"}},"_id":"u9xWKjDzL6L2y4kP"}
