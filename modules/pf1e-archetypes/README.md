## Important!

### Prestige Classes

Prestige classes should be implimented as best as possible given current pf1 rules. They have their description text, along with HD, HP, class skills, saves, etc., as well as linked features that should be gained at the appropriate levels. The added features do not have changes or attacks, and will have to be adjusted, however all the the information and rules are present. They do not automatically increase levels to base classes, like prestige classes normally do.

### Archetypes

The Archetype items are not fully implimented. They simply have their description text (From AON) and feature list - no hd, hp, saves, etc. The archetypes are included as miscellaneous features in the Feature Browser; neither the achetypes nor the class abilities do not have changes or attacks. They should have all the required information to make use of the ability (and add appropriate changes when needed).

For Archetype features, the icons are similar, though different from their base class (to set them apart). Each has the name and the archetype in ( ) after. Features of the archetype that match the original class were not included.

Given the amount of entries, it's possible we missed some, or accidentally removed some that shouldn't have been. So be sure to double-check the ability on AON to be sure. You'll want to keep track of what level you gain the increased benefits and adjust manually, or make the changes scale with level as appropriate.

With all these combined, you should be able to easily make the archetypes work, or simply replace your existing classes' features with the archetypes. I am unsure how archetypes plan to be implemented in pf1 sys in the future, so I opted for this route, though it requires some "assembly."
