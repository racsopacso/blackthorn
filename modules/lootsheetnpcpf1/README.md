# Pathfinder 1e NPC Loot Sheet

This module adds an additional NPC sheet which can be used for loot containers such as chests. It also allows spells to be automatically converted into spell scrolls by dragging them onto this sheet.

This version was forked from AlmightyGir's module (https://github.com/Almightygir/fvtt-loot-sheet-npc-pf1/), which was forked from Sven Werlen's module (https://github.com/SvenWerlen/fvtt-loot-sheet-npc-pf1), which was a port of Jan Ole Peek's module (https://github.com/jopeek/fvtt-loot-sheet-npc-5e) to the PF1 game system.
This fork will be maintained separately and specifically for Pathfinder 1.

### Features

##### Permissions & split money

- Permissions can be set in the sheet for each player and range from no access (cannot open sheet) to limited (view sheet and contents) to observer (view sheet and add/remove items).
- Any coins in the sheet can easily be split evenly across all players with observer access. The math and distribution is done for you via a single click if you're the GM.
