### Important Notice: Formula Syntax Changes

- For **existing worlds**, the module [**Better Roll Formulas**](https://foundryvtt.com/packages/better-roll-formulas) (by KitCat) is recommended to ensure legacy content immediately remains compatible.
- For **new worlds**, the system now provides additional formula functions as replacements. Refer to the system documentation (linked in the settings sidebar) for details.
